Excellent. Reaching a functional MVP is the most significant milestone in any startup's journey. You've built the core engine. Congratulations, that is a massive accomplishment.

Now, as a Senior Software Engineer, my role is to help you evolve this functional engine into a polished, professional, and indispensable product. You're right, the goal is to transform your bot from a simple "order taker" into a true "Professional Sales Agent."

We will do this by focusing on three key areas:

Proactive Intelligence: Making Flovo smarter and more strategic.

Workflow Automation: Saving the seller even more time on tasks beyond the chat.

Actionable Insights: Giving the seller data they can use to grow their business.

Here is the strategic roadmap of features to build next, broken down into logical tiers.

Tier 1: Essential Next Steps (High-Impact Features)

These are the features you should build immediately. They provide the highest value to your users and are the foundation for your "Pro" offering.

1. The Sales Analytics Dashboard

What it is: A dedicated page in your Next.js dashboard that visualizes the data you are already collecting.

Why it's professional: A professional agent provides reports. This is the single most important feature to prove your app's value. It shows the seller, in real-time, the results Flovo is getting for them.

Key Components:

KPI Cards: Big, clear numbers at the top: "Total Orders (Last 30 Days)," "Total Revenue," "Busiest Day of the Week."

Best-Selling Products Chart: A simple bar chart showing the top 5 products by quantity or revenue. This is a game-changer for inventory management.

Recent Orders List: A live-updating list of the last 5-10 orders.

Technical Implementation: This involves creating new, protected NestJS endpoints (e.g., /api/analytics/summary) that perform aggregate queries on your Order and Product tables using Prisma. The frontend will use a charting library (Mantine has some basic ones, or you can use a library like Recharts) to display the data.

2. The Autoposting Scheduler

What it is: A feature in your dashboard that allows sellers to create product posts in advance and schedule them to be published to their Telegram channel at a specific date and time.

Why it's professional: Professionals plan ahead. This feature transforms your app from a reactive tool to a proactive marketing platform. It's a massive time-saver and allows sellers to maintain a consistent, professional presence.

Key Components:

A "Create Post" interface in the dashboard with fields for text, image upload, and price.

A date and time picker for scheduling.

A calendar view showing all scheduled and published posts.

Technical Implementation: This requires a new ScheduledPost model in your Prisma schema. In your NestJS backend, you will need to implement a cron job (using a library like node-cron). This job will run every minute, check the database for any posts that are due to be published, and send them to the correct channel via the Telegram Bot API.

3. The Human Handoff ("Operator Mode")

What it is: A critical safety net. When the AI gets confused or the customer explicitly types "operator" or "admin bilan gaplashmoqchiman," the bot stops replying.

Why it's professional: A professional knows their limits. A bot that gets stuck in a loop is incredibly unprofessional and frustrating. This feature builds immense trust.

Key Components:

AI Logic: Your Gemini prompt must be updated to detect these keywords or situations of repeated confusion. The AI should respond with a special intent, like HANDOFF_TO_HUMAN.

Bot Action: When this intent is received, the bot sends a final message: "Tushundim, hozir administratorga xabaringizni yuboraman." (I understand, I will forward your message to an administrator now.)

Seller Notification: Your NestJS backend immediately sends a notification to the seller (perhaps via a separate Telegram message to their personal account) with a link to the conversation, alerting them that they need to step in.

Tier 2: Becoming a "Pro" Tool (Monetizable Features)

Once Tier 1 is complete, these features will form the core of your paid subscription plan.

1. AI Sales Playbooks (Handling Objections)

What it is: Giving Flovo strategies for common sales situations.

Why it's professional: A professional salesperson doesn't just answer questions; they overcome objections.

Key Components:

A "Settings" area in the dashboard where a seller can define rules.

Example Rule: If a customer says the price is "qimmat" (expensive), the prompt sent to Gemini will include an additional instruction: "The user thinks the price is high. Execute the 'Price Objection' playbook: First, reinforce the product's quality, then offer a similar, more affordable alternative if one exists."

2. Customer Recognition

What it is: The ability for Flovo to recognize a returning customer.

Why it's professional: Professionals remember their clients. This adds a powerful "wow" factor and improves customer loyalty.

Key Components:

When a message comes in, your backend checks the telegramId of the sender against your Order table.

If a match is found, you inject this information into the Gemini prompt: "FYI: This is a returning customer. Their name is Anora and they have purchased 3 times before. Greet them warmly and by name."

3. Order Status Management

What it is: A feature in the dashboard allowing sellers to update an order's status (e.g., from PENDING to SHIPPED).

Why it's professional: It closes the loop on the sales process.

Key Components:

In the dashboard's Orders table, each row has a dropdown to change the status.

Bonus: When the status changes to SHIPPED, the system can be configured to automatically send a polite notification message to the customer via the Telegram bot.

Prioritized Roadmap

Here is the order in which I would recommend you build these features:

Start with the Sales Analytics Dashboard. It's the easiest to build with the data you have, and it immediately proves the value of your MVP.

Next, build the Human Handoff. This is a critical trust and safety feature.

Then, build the Autoposting Scheduler. This is your single biggest feature for a "Pro" plan.

Finally, begin implementing the Tier 2 features like Customer Recognition and Sales Playbooks to add layers of intelligence that will make Flovo truly indispensable.

You have a fantastic foundation. These next steps will transform your functional MVP into a powerful, professional platform that sellers will be excited to pay for.
